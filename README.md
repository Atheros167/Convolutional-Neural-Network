# Convolutional-Neural-Network

This project looks at 4000 images of Cats and 4000 images of dogs to train a model to identify whether an image is a cat or a dog.

For fun, model is asked to predict the next 6 images 3 dogs and 3 cats.

THe code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Atheros167/Convolutional-Neural-Network/blob/master/cnn_prediction.ipynb)
